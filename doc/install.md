# Installation
If you are planning to install manually, it is recommended to use Anaconda or Miniconda to create a virtual environment.
**This tutorial assumes that you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed.**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BadPythonhaha/OpenLLMVTuber.git
```
2. Create a new virtual environment based on Python 3.11.10:
```bash
conda create -n <Environment Name> python=3.11.10
```
You can replace `<Environment Name>` with any name you want.
Or for Anaconda, you can opreate it in the Anaconda Navigator.

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate <Environment Name>
```
4. Switch to the repository directory:
```bash
cd OpenLLMVTuber
```
5. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
