## What is this?

This is a modified version of the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/t41372/Open-LLM-VTuber), only using Ollama, FunASR and MeloTTS as the main components. Aiming to provide a more lightweight and easy-to-use solution for creating and running VTubers on your local machine, and trying to make it easier for Windows users to use. 

Plus, now I'm trying to make a "one-click" installation package for Windows users, so they can easily install and run the program without any trouble.

## Installation

See [Installation](./doc/install.md) or [Installation_CN](./doc/install_CN.md) for more details.
